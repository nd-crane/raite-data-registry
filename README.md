# RAITE Dataset Registry

This repository contains the RAITE [data registry](https://dvc.org/doc/use-cases/data-registry). It is a [DVC](https://dvc.org/) repository that contains the metadata of the datasets used in the RAITE project.
The RAITE 2023 dataset is governed by specific data usage and sharing policies in compliance with IRB regulations. While the repository containing metadata and code is public, access to the actual data is restricted.

1. **Sign the [License Agreement](raite-2023-dataset-release-agreement.pdf)**: The license agreement must be signed by a person authorized to legally represent the requesting institution. The agreement outlines the terms and conditions under which the data can be used.

2. **Request Access**: Send a request to [cvrl@nd.edu](mailto:cvrl@nd.edu) with the signed license agreement. Once the agreement is reviewed and approved, download instructions will be provided.
